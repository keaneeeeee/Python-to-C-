# Python-to-C-
C++ is more difficult to program compared to Python since it needs explicit syntax, type declarations, and structured control flow, while Python utilizes less complex syntax and intrinsic data types such as dictionaries. The Python version of the program is more efficient and compact as it gets dictionary values directly, whereas the C++ version is based on several if-else cases, making it longer and more laborious to code. Converting from Python to C++ was time-consuming since C++ needed more manual work, including input handling and output formatting, unlike Python's direct approach.
